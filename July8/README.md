This portrait is of me on my grandmother's balcony overlooking the sea. Off the coast there is an old military base (the building in white) and is often visited by seabirds. My grandmother's house is very special to me for as it's the central gathering point of my far flung family, this particular vista is iconic for friends and family.

While making this image I found Google's Color Picker function especially helpful to easily get the RGB codes for colors. Designing the sun's rays was one aspcet of the image which I initally struggled with as I had to get used to the coordinate system and its peculiarites.
