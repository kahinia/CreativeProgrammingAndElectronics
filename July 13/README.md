My inspiration for this project came from the shipping packaging of glasses. Though the package itself did not contain a similar graphic, I set out to create a piece focusing on eyes. My initial design randomly placed and colored eyes all over the screen, however this became far too visually busy. This final design uses the transformation functionality of Processing to replicate the open and closed eye design over a 3x2 grid while still letting the colors run freely. Functions were used for the base components (background and eye shape) and independent functions for the details of the open and close eyes, with a selector with a 2/3 chance of selecting an open eye. 
The aspect of design which proved to be the greatest challenge for me was the base shape of the eye, as I used two BÃ©zier curves to get the desired shape. Ultimately I used Desmos (graphing software) to map out the vertices and anchor points on a coordinate grid.
