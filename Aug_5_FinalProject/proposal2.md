Second Draft Proposal

	Refining my initial concept, I think setting certain limitations to the endeavour will make it more manageable in the given time frame and capacity. In order to circumvent the issues of canvas mirroring, I will use the relative position of the bot to set and reset the image location. Given I have not begun to physically explore the limits of the bot’s pivoting and drawing capabilities it may mean that the input shapes and values will be abstracted by the limits of the bot. Ultimately to make a compact robot with two independently running motors I will have to ensure that there is sufficient power available in the design and ensure that the communication between Processing and the Romeo are compatible.
  
	The biggest risk I foresee is running into issues with the positional translation from screen and xy coordinates in pixels to movement of a physical object. Right now I can play with these set ups and learn more about how I can translate these types of on screen movement into commands for a drawing machine. Like ship movements I may convert these positions into “times” i.e. distance covered by duration of time.
