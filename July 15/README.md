Homework 3: Simple Game

This game was inspired by my mother's love for Japanese flower arranging (Ikebana). I set out to create a simple catch-the-falling-object game and incorporating elements of natural movement to add challenge. The game consists of flowers falling down the screen and a mouse controlled basket at the bottom of the screen. The objective is to catch the flowers as they fall until 10 are caught and the game terminates. 
When creating this game I wasn't sure the artistic direction I wanted to go in so thorughout the process I used basic placeholders from the Processing Shape Primitives. I referenced skeleton components from Catch Game from OpenProcessing.org (project linked below) to guide the structure of the game and built my own elements. Throughout the process I enountered many challenges, including with image formatting and especially with the interactivity. Ultimately with the help of the Processing reference I settled on using mouse controls for the movement of the basket and learned a lot through the image manipulation process.
