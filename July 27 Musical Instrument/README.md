My inspiration for this project is the repetitive melody of Johann Strauss IIâ€™s most famous work The Blue Danube Waltz. When simplified, this piece has four simple melodic elements which correspond to the four push buttons in the class kit. I used the servo as a metronome by adding a bamboo skewer to tap on a plastic toy to help the player time their cues. 

While building the mechanical aspects of the instrument, I had trouble with overcrowding of the breadboard and wire organization. In order to simplify as much as possible, I kept the buzzer and servo elements off the board by using some wires I had on hand. 

Going forward I would refine the control systems as the switches I have employed are unreliable (requires multiple presses/ changed angles) to play. Additionally, I would add a knob to adjust the volume of the speaker and find better sonic implements for the servo metronome.
